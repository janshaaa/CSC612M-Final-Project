Do the following steps to run the keyword spotting on the microcontrollers:
1.  Download Arduino IDE and the libraries needed for each microcontroller
2.  Download the libraries (Models) provided
3.  Include library in Arduino IDE (Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library...)
4.  Connect a microcontroller and run the provided code for that microcontroller
5.  Run the streamdatawav.py to stream the data into the microcontroller
6.  Observe output for results
